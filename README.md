- ðŸ‘‹ Hello my name is StÃ©phane, I am passionate about new technology, here in particular by additive manufacturing. 
- I am also passionate about photos, by DSLR or drones, I own two of the most famous drones. 
- I also love the sea, scuba diving and all underwater or water sports.
- I think I master a software: Soliworks rather well, it serves me all the time and for example for 3d printing, I use it to make my own plans
- I like to exchange with experienced people and bring also modestly some of my knowledge.
- I am naturally very curious.
- I also make plans of stairs, railings, gates etc ... but only the plans now,
 because I'm 50 years old and I think I've been in various manufacturing workshops since I was 19.
- I also had a company with a dozen people for 12 years. 
- That's I think you save a little more on me now. 
- And in advance thank you to all those who will help me in the particular 3d printing.
